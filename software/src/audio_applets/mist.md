## Overview

Mist is a live granular audio processor for the Phazerville/Hemisphere audio applet framework. It continuously records incoming audio into a 1-second PSRAM circular buffer and plays it back as a cloud of overlapping grains. The result ranges from subtle shimmer and smear to dense, pitch-shifted clouds and frozen textural loops.

Available as both MONO and STEREO instantiations.

## Signal Flow

```
Audio In ──► AudioEffectMist (grain cloud) ──► AudioMixer<2> ──► Audio Out
Audio In ──────────────────────────────────► (dry channel) ──►
```

The wet (granular) and dry (live) signals are blended by the **Mix** parameter.

## Parameters

### Page 1

| Param | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Pos** | 0–100% | Read position in the buffer. 0% = current (live), 100% = 1 second ago. |
| **Den** | 1–50 Hz | Grain spawn rate. Higher values produce a denser, smoother cloud. |
| **Sz** | 10–500 ms | Grain duration. Short = glitchy fragments; long = smooth smear. |
| **Spr** | 0–100% | Position scatter. Randomises each grain's start point around Pos. |

### Page 2

| Param | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Pt** | −12 to +12 st | Pitch shift in semitones. Unity = 0. |
| **PSp** | 0–100% | Pitch spread. Randomises each grain's pitch by up to ±1 octave (quadratic curve — most resolution at low values). |
| **Frz** | gate / latch | Freeze. Stops the write pointer so grains replay a fixed snapshot of the buffer. |
| **Mix** | 0–100% | Wet/dry blend (equal-power crossfade). 0% = dry only, 100% = grains only. |
| **Shp** | Sine/Tri/R-Up/R-Dn | Grain envelope shape. Sine (Hann) = smoothest; ramps = edgier attacks/releases. |

All parameters except Frz and Shp accept CV modulation via assignable CV inputs.

## Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Encoder (browse) | Navigate cursor through parameters |
| Encoder (edit) | Adjust parameter value |
| Button | Enter/exit edit mode; assign CV input when cursor is on a CV slot |
| **Aux button** | Latch/unlatch manual freeze — for live performance without a gate cable |

---

## CV / Gate Inputs

Each parameter (except Shape) has an assignable CV input slot. Freeze also accepts a gate/digital input. Inputs are assigned using the in-applet CV input editor (press button when cursor is on a CV label).

---

## Freeze

Freeze halts the write pointer. Grains continue to spawn and play from the frozen buffer, creating a looping granular texture from the captured moment. Two ways to freeze:

- **Gate input** on the Frz parameter (hardware gate cable)
- **Aux button** latch (no cable needed — great for live use)

When latched, the Frz row label is inverted on screen.

---

## Activity Display

A row of pixels at the top of the display (y=7) shows active grain count in real time — one pixel per active grain, up to 12 maximum.

---

## Technical Notes

- Buffer: 44100 samples (~1 second) stored in PSRAM (EXTMEM). Falls back to half-size in OCRAM if no PSRAM is present. Displays "No PSRAM" if unavailable.
- Grains: up to 12 simultaneous grains per channel. Output scaled by 0.25 for headroom.
- Interpolation: Hermite cubic interpolation on grain read pointer for smooth pitch shifting.
- Grain envelope: Hann (sin²), Triangle, Ramp-Up, or Ramp-Down — selected by Shape.
- Pitch spread uses a per-grain random semitone offset applied at spawn time, mapped via a quadratic curve for fine control at low values.
